Keep the ordering of the URLS and CurrentVersions the same.

Ex: If CurrentVersions.txt has the second line as Tomcat, URLS.txt second line should also be to do with Tomcat.
This also applies for the dependencies.txt naming list


The folder containing this document must have 2 .txt files:
CurrentVersions.txt
URLS.txt

-The output of a script should write the CurrentVersions.txt

-URLS.txt will need to be self written, find URL of download website and copy and paste it into a new line. 

-Format must be kept inorder for the script to continue to work

-Company script should write the output into the CurrentVersions.txt file
