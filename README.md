# UpdateScript
Reads through notepad for current versions of software and lists out current version(self inputted), and latest version (from website).
This is a maven project

Instructions: 

1.Inside updateScript-ManualCheckV3\src\main\resources\file, there will be a textfile called ReadMe, that will explain what information you are to write in the text files. 

2. Open up the project in a code editor and look into the VersionTemplate class. Read the instructions on it. 
If you need further help, there is a VersionTomcat7 class which you can use for reference. 

3. After inputting your needed software in the textfiles and creating your own classes (using VersionTemplate), run the script using your editing tool and read the printouts to check for mismatched versions! Enjoy!

This project served as a learning tool for when I first learned about Maven, please feel free to offer any suggestions!
